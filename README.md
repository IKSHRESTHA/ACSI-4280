## Project Overview
This final project is designed to guide you through the complete data science workflow as outlined in "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham. You are required to use the dataset and associated project resources provided in this repository. The submission is divided into two main parts: a Written Report and a Presentation.
The project should demonstrate your ability to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data using R and its associated packages. You are encouraged to incorporate dynamic elements such as interactive visualizations or Shiny applications to enhance your project’s interactivity and engagement.

## Submission Components

### 1. Written Report
Your written report should be a comprehensive document that covers the following sections:

#### a. Title Page
- **Course Title:** ACSI 4280  
- **Student Name:** [Your Name]  
- **Project Title:** [Your Project Title]  
- **Submission Date:** May 8  

#### b. Table of Contents
- Include a clearly organized list of all major sections and subsections with page numbers.

#### c. Introduction
- **Project Overview:** Describe the project’s purpose and objectives.
- **Problem Statement:** Clearly define the problem you are addressing.
- **Data Source:** Explain that the dataset is sourced from the provided GitHub repository.
- **Tools & Technologies:** List R and key packages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, tidymodels), as well as any dynamic tools (e.g., Shiny) used in the project.

#### d. Data Collection & Importing
- Detail the process of data collection and importing (using functions like `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, etc.).
- Provide code snippets and mention any challenges encountered during this stage.

#### e. Data Cleaning & Tidying
- Explain the steps taken to clean the data (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.) and reshape it into a tidy format.
- Include relevant code examples using `tidyr` and `dplyr`.

#### f. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Provide summary statistics (using functions like `summary()` or packages like `skimr`).
- Include visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc.) created with `ggplot2`.
- Discuss the insights, trends, and any anomalies found during the analysis.

#### g. Model Building & Evaluation
- Describe the chosen model(s) (e.g., regression, classification, clustering) and justify your selection.
- Include code for model training (using functions like `lm()`, and packages such as `caret` or `tidymodels`).
- Discuss model evaluation metrics (e.g., R², RMSE, accuracy) and include evaluation results.
- **Dynamic Feature:** If possible, integrate interactive model evaluation dashboards to show real-time performance metrics.

#### h. Results & Insights
- Summarize the main findings from your analysis and model results.
- Compare the model performance against initial expectations.
- Discuss any limitations or challenges encountered.

#### i. Conclusion & Future Work
- Recap the overall project and its outcomes.
- Suggest potential improvements or further analyses for future work.

#### j. References & Appendix
- Cite all datasets, literature, and external resources used.
- Include supplementary materials such as additional code snippets, extended visualizations, or screenshots.

#### a. Slide Deck Structure
- **Title Slide:** Include project title, your name, course title, and submission date.
- **Agenda:** Outline the main topics you will cover.
- **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the project objectives and problem statement.
- **Methodology:** Summarize your data collection, cleaning, and analysis process.
- **EDA and Findings:** Use key visuals (charts, graphs) to illustrate data insights.
  - **Dynamic Element:** Embed links or QR codes to interactive dashboards or Shiny app demos.
- **Model Building:** Summarize the model selection, training, and evaluation process.
- **Results & Discussion:** Highlight the main findings and discuss any challenges or limitations.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize key takeaways and suggest directions for future work.
- **Q&A Slide:** Prepare a slide to invite audience questions.

#### b. Design and Delivery Tips
- Ensure slides are visually appealing with a consistent style (fonts, colors, layout).
- Use bullet points, infographics, and dynamic elements to convey your message effectively.
- Practice your presentation to ensure clear, confident delivery.
